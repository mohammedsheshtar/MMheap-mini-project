## Introduction
Priority queues are a type of data structure that is widely used in computer science. A priority queue is an abstract data type that stores a collection of elements and provides access to the element with the highest priority. The priority can be defined by the user or can be derived from the element's attributes. In this assignment, we will be implementing a priority queue known as a multimodal priority queue (MMHeap). The MMheap program implements a min-max heap data structure. The Min-Max Heap is a variation of the binary heap data structure that supports both minimum and maximum priority values. It is like a binary heap, but with the additional property that every leaf node is at the same level. This allows for efficient operations on the heap, such as finding both the minimum and maximum elements in constant time. The purpose of this program is to compute an array that follows the previously mentioned min-max heap property where each new level will not violate minimum and maximum values of their predecessors even when some values are extracted from the array or inserted into the array, it must always order the array so that no violations will occur.
